\makelettertitle

I am excited to accept the offer of the career position as the Director of the UCLA Libraries Social Sciences Data Archive. I agree to the the salary and terms you outlined in the March 16, 2017 offer letter to me. Thank you for the opportunity and I look forward working with everyone at the UCLA Library.

The only caveat I have is that the start date of April 17th specified in the letter will need to be flexible in order to account for the time it might take to coordinate with the movers and finalize things in San Diego. This might take a few more days than anticipated. Once we have an apartment lined up and the movers set, I should know if the the 17th will work as a start date or if we will need to push it back a few days. I'm hoping it still will work.

Regardless, thank you again for the opportunity to join you and your staff at the UCLA Library.
