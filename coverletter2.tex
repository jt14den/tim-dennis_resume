I am inquiring about employment for the Software Engineer position you advertised on Hacker News.

I currently am employed by a small research company in Santa Barbara
named Toyon Research Corporation as an Analyst/Software Engineer.
During my employment there I have been developing development and build system for a stereo vision ROS node as well as experimental resource management and simulation applications in \cpp.
In support of these applications, I have also done extensive analysis in \cpp \space and Python.
I believe that my previous experience will strongly relate to the work Cruise is doing in bring self driving cars to the world.
Constantly learning and pushing my knowledge of new technical skills is important to me,
and it looks like this position and working with the Cruise team would allow me to do just that.
I feel that the combination of my skills and my desire and ability to quickly learn new skills
could make me be a valuable asset to your team and help you change the change the automotive industry.

I look forward to discussing my qualifications further and can be reached by email at
\href{loman.daniel@gmail.com}{\textcolor{color2}{loman.daniel@gmail.com}}.
